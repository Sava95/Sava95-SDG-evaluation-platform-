    <h4> Purpose of the platform </h4>

    <p> The purpose of MACS SDG Platform is collection of expert opinion on the relevance of economic activities within individual
        sectors as per NACE classification system on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and respective SDG targets.
        This information will be used for standardized evaluation of investments and investment portfolios with respect to their
        SDG relevance and will form the data basis for MACS SDG scoring products.
    </p>

    <h4 style="margin-top:50px"> What are the SDGs? </h4>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by the UN in 2015 and are expected to be achieved by 2030.
        Meanwhile, the SDGs are becoming even more important for Financial Institutions in their sustainability strategies and reporting.
        It is only through a mutual commitment and joint effort that the SDGs ambitious targets are accomplished.

    <h4> How to use the SDG Evaluation Platform? </h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The SDG Evaluation Platform is an online based approach for evaluating and comparing
        specific targets within the sustainable development goals (SDGs). The SDGs are identical for each sector and are evaluated separately.
        Sector evaluations are considered complete, and therefore eligible for comparison, when all 17 SDGs are evaluated. Each sector evaluation
        can be later reopened and modified or continued if not complete.
    </p>

    <h5> <i> Home Page </i> </h5>
    <ul style="margin-bottom:10px">
        <li style="text-align: justify; padding-bottom:10px">
            <i> Please select NACE sector </i> - Select the sector that you wish you evaluated from the dropdown menu and click 'Edit'. This
             will take you to the evaluation page where you can start evaluating the SDGs for the selected sector.
        </li>

        <li style="text-align: justify;  padding-bottom:10px">
            <i> Do you want to copy the evaluation from another sector? </i> - In case you have already completed the evaluation of a sector,
            and wish to copy all the evaluations from one sector to another, select the option 'yes' from the dropdown menu after which a new
            dropdown menu will appear asking you to select the sector to which you want to copy the evaluations too. To copy the evaluations
            click 'Copy'.
        </li>

         <li style="text-align: justify;  padding-bottom:10px">
            <i> Overview table </i> - At the end of the page lies the overview table. This table displays all sectors that you have evaluated,
             a sign that signals if you have completed the evaluations of a sector (All Fields Checked) and the date of last modification. Clicking
             on the sector name will automatically redirect you to the evaluation page where you can continue/modify your evaluation.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <details>
        <summary style="color:#007bff"> <i> More Details </i> </summary>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> In order to choose the sector that you wish to evaluate, select one of the available
            sectors under the label 'Please select NACE sector:' and click 'Edit'. This will open the sector evaluation page where
            you can start evaluating the SDGs for the selected sector. If you have already evaluated a sector, the platform offers
            a way to quickly copy all the evaluations from one sector to another. To do this, firstly select the option 'Yes' under label
            'Do you want to copy the evaluation from another sector?', after which a new dropdown menu will appear that will ask you
            to choose the sector from which you would like to copy the evaluations. Once you have selected the sector click 'Copy' to complete the process.

            An overview of all evaluated sectors is represented as a table just below the mentioned features. In this table,
            besides the sector names and dates of last modification there is a column labeled 'All Fields Check' that indicated
            if all 17 SDGs are evaluated. If so, in that column sector, there will be a
            <img src="/static/survey/images/check.png" alt="Check Sign" width="16" height="16"> sign, otherwise there will be a
            <img src="/static/survey/images/X.png" alt="Check Sign" width="16" height="16"> sign.

            To reopen a sector evaluation, you can either select the sector from the 'Please select NACE sector:' list, or click on the sector name
            in the overview table.

    <h5 style="margin-top:30px"> <i> Sector Evaluation Page </i> </h5>
    <ul>
        <li style="text-align: justify;  padding-bottom:10px">
            <i> Navigation sidebar </i> - The scrollable navigation sidebar is located on the left side of the page. By clicking on
            one of the SDGs, the page will automatically scroll to that part of the page that displays the selected SDG. When you
            successfully save the evaluation, a <img src="/static/survey/images/check.png" alt="Check Sign" width="16" height="16"> sign will appear.

        <li style="text-align: justify;  padding-bottom:10px">
            <i> Evaluation </i> -  Each SDG evaluation consists of target evaluations that contain several data fields that need to be filled in
            with your personal opinion. In order to complete the SDG evaluation you must evaluate all the targets within it.
            Each target evaluation contains the following fields:

            <ul>
                <li style="padding-bottom:5px"> Relevance - Possible answers: positive, negative, neutral </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:5px"> Predefined Comments - Set of predefined comments for both positive and negative relevance </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:5px"> Location specific flag ( <img src="/static/survey/images/world_icon.svg" alt="Check Sign" width="16" height="16"> ) -
                    Checkbox that indicates if the target is location specific or not</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:5px"> Notes - Personal Notes that you can use to write your thoughts about the target. In case you want to write your own personal comment </li>
                (that is not in the 'Predefined Comments' list) select the option 'Other' in the comments section and then write your personal comment in this section.

            </ul>

    <details style="margin-bottom:30px">
        <summary style="color:#007bff"> <i> More Details </i> </summary>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom:50px">
            On this page all the SDGs, along with their targets, are represented. The evaluations are done on a 'goal based' level, meaning that the tool
            simultaneously saves all the target evaluations within the same goal. Keep in mind that in order to save the goal evaluation you must first
            evaluate all of its target evaluations. Each target evaluation consists of 4 parts: relevance, comment, location specific flag
            and notes. The relevance of a target can be either positive, negative or neutral. In order to clarify your answer, you can select
            up to 5 comments from the comment dropdown menu. There are different sets of comments for positive and negative relevance while for neutral relevance
            you can choose both positive and negative predefined comments. If you wish to write your own comment, you can select the 'Other' option in the comment
            dropdown menu and then in the 'Notes' section write your own comment.

            The location specific flag ( <img src="/static/survey/images/world_icon.svg" alt="Check Sign" width="16" height="16"> ), represented as a checkbox,
            can be 'checked' or 'unchecked' depending on if you think that the target is location specific for the selected sector. In the notes section you can
            write your thoughts and resounding behind your answers.
